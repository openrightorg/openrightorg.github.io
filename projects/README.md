dbc-kcd conversion

### Klaatu (2014)

Klaatu is a minimal Linux which reuses the hardware support provided in
an Android release, while removing Dalvik and above. This provides a
minimal embedded Linux system supported by Android vendor support, while
keeping flexibility of user interfaces (including headless, Kivy,
qt/qml, and others) or other customizations.

### SiGal (2014)

Modifications to SiGal, a simple php gallery, for use on a home photo
server \* lazy loading of initial thumbnail (generation), to unblock
image loading \* video thumbnail generation \* automatic video
conversion for HTML5 browser playback. \* support sub-galleries and
allow custom album directory functions, like flattening \* bug fixes

### Apandor (2014)

apandor - experimental player that communicates using a subset of the
pandora bluetooth protocol. Reverse engineered from automotive and
mobile communication.

### NodeJS/JS development example (2013)

### Wavelet experiments

I had worked on C and Python/Pylab programs to analyze and manipulate
sound using Continuous Wavelet Transforms.

(If interested, I can find and post the source).

### Client-side Javascript .chopro parser

See chordpro.js and examples at
[jam.openright.org](http://jam.openright.org/ "http://jam.openright.org/"),
to see how JavaScript (in the client browser) can be used to convert
.chopro text files into pretty guitar music. Use “View Source” to see
the original .chopro text.

### CSound experiments

CSound is an audio programming language released in 1986, yet can
perform quite advance sound creation and manipulation. Here are two
potentially interesting uses of Csound:

#### Singing with CSound

See ["Singing with Csound”](../csound-sing "../csound-sing")
to learn how I used CSound to create music with a modeled synthesized
Singing voice that replaces a MIDI instrument.

#### Atari Pokey simulation using CSound

See ["Atari Pokey to Csound Conversion"](../csound-pokey "../csound-pokey") to
learn how I used CSound to simulate Atari Pokey sound synthesis either
in real time with a modified atari800 emulator or offline using
previously captured SAP files.

### DVD backup X

dvdbackupx was a version of dvdbackup that uses libdvdnav to find and skip unused
blocks to avoid potentially bad sectors.

### Linux Kernel based (iptables/netfilter) based UDP relay

udprelay was a netfilter kernel module and IP tables modification that allow a
high volume of UDP packages to be relayed through the kernel.

### WebKNotes

[WebKNotes](https://github.com/dmahurin/webknotes "https://github.com/dmahurin/webknotes") is a
web based knowledge database,
which is entirely client-side
Javascript. All markup parsing will be performed on the client side (for
.wiki, .chopro, …).

### Perl/Linux

[Perl/Linux](http://perllinux.sf.net/ "http://perllinux.sf.net/") was a
Linux distribution where all user space programs are written in Perl.
While this was potentially useful for an embedded platform, it was
mostly just a fun project.

### MinCrossLinux

[MinCrossLinux](http://mincrosslinux.sf.net/ "http://mincrosslinux.sf.net/")
was an embedded, package based Linux distribution build system. It was
used on NSLU2 and WDTV devices, but is not maintained. I would instead
suggest the openwrt or openembedded depending on your requirements.

### NFTE

[NFTE](http://nfte.sf.net/ "http://nfte.sf.net/") is a modification of
the FTE to create a minimal yet intuitive editor (think DOS edit). I
also created the NCurses frontend.

### Other projects (very old)

I have made contributions to several other open source projects
including NMEAP, Konsole, BOA, Intermezzo, XPilot, FVWM.
